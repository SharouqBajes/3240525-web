  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    In today's digitally interconnected world, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical issue that affects individuals,
    corporations, and governments alike. As technology becomes more deeply integrated into our daily lives — from
    communication and commerce to healthcare and education — the need to protect digital systems and data becomes
    increasingly urgent.

    Cyberattacks are no longer rare incidents limited to IT departments; they are real, widespread threats that can
    cripple infrastructure, steal identities, and cost millions. As such, understanding cybersecurity is not just an
    option — it’s a necessity in the modern age.

  <h1> <strong>What is Cybersecurity?</strong></h1>

  <p>
    Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer<mark> systems, networks, software, and data </mark>from unauthorized
    access, damage, or theft. It involves a range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to secure the
    integrity, confidentiality, and availability of digital information.

    It covers everything from antivirus software and firewalls to encryption and multi-factor authentication.
    Cybersecurity also includes human behavior, such as creating strong passwords or avoiding suspicious links, making
    it both a technical and a social discipline.
  </p>
  <h1>The Evolution of Cybersecurity</h1>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity has not always been as advanced or as necessary as it is today. Its evolution reflects the rapid
    development of computing and the internet:

    1960s–1980s: Focus was on physical security of computers. Very few users, mostly government and research labs.

    1990s: The internet goes public. Email viruses and simple worms begin to spread. Antivirus software emerges.

    2000s: Rise of ecommerce and social media. Hackers start targeting personal data and company servers.

    2010s–2020s: Threats become more advanced: ransomware, state-sponsored attacks, and data breaches on massive scales.

    As digital infrastructure becomes essential to nearly every sector — finance, health, energy, transportation —
    cybersecurity has become a global priority.
  </p>
  <h1> Why Cybersecurity Matters</h1>
  <p>
    The importance of cybersecurity lies in its ability to protect our digital lives. Here are a few reasons why it's
    essential:
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Data Protection</li>: Personal information, financial records, and business secrets must be protected from
    unauthorized
    access.

    <li>Continuity</li>: Cyberattacks can shut down systems, halt operations, and cause long-term reputational damage.

    <li>National Security</li>: Governments face constant threats from cyber warfare, targeting power grids,
    transportation, and
    communication networks.

    <li>Economic Stability</li>: A single cyberattack on a major financial institution can ripple through global
    markets.

      Without cybersecurity, trust in digital systems would collapse — and so would many aspects of modern society.

  <h1>Common Types of Cyber Attacks</h1>
  <p>
  <ul>
    Cyberattacks come in various forms, each with unique methods and goals. Here are the most common ones:

    <li>Malware (Malicious Software)</li>
    : Viruses, worms, Trojans, and spyware that infiltrate and damage systems.

    <li>Phishing</li>
    : Fake emails or websites designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or
    credit card numbers.

    <li>Ransomware</li>
    : Encrypts the victim’s files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.

    <li>Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS)</li>
    : Overwhelms servers with traffic, causing them to crash and become unavailable.

    <li>SQL Injection</li>
    : Exploits vulnerabilities in databases by injecting malicious code through input fields.

    <li>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)</li>
    : Attackers intercept communication between two parties to steal or manipulate data.

    <li>Zero-Day Exploits</li>
    : Attacks that occur before a software vulnerability is discovered and patched by developers.

  </ul>
  </p>
  <h1> Cybersecurity Threats and Risks</h1>
  <p>

    The digital world faces a growing list of threats that evolve in complexity. These risks affect individuals, small
    businesses, and massive corporations alike.
    <br>
    <b>
      Identity Theft
    </b>
    : Attackers steal personal data to impersonate victims for fraud.
    <br>
    <b>
      Financial Loss
    </b>
    : Companies lose revenue due to stolen customer data, regulatory fines, and loss of reputation.
    <br>
    <b>
      Espionage
    </b>
    : Both corporate and political, where attackers steal confidential plans or government secrets
    <br>
    <b>
      Cyber Terrorism
    </b>
    : Groups may attempt to destabilize national infrastructure or economies.
    <br>
    Cyber risks are often multifaceted, blending technical weakness, human error, and inadequate policy.
